# üìö First Library Configuration

Set up your first library to organize and manage your digital book collection. A library monitors one or more folders for automatic indexing and metadata enrichment.

## üìñ Understanding Libraries

A **library** is a logical grouping of book folders with its own configuration and metadata cache. Each library can monitor multiple folders, but folders can only belong to one library.

**Supported Formats:** EPUB, PDF, CBZ, CBR, and CB7

:::tip[Multiple Libraries]
Create separate libraries for different collections (e.g., Novels, Comics, Technical Books).

- Multiple folders can be added to one library
- Remove folders using the ‚ùå button
- Ensure Docker has read permissions for selected paths

:::warning[Permissions]
Check Docker volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml` if folders aren't accessible.
:::

Click **"Save"** to begin processing.

**Processing includes:**
1. Folder scanning for supported files
2. Metadata extraction from books
3. Cover thumbnail generation
4. Database indexing

:::info[Background Processing]
Processing continues in the background. Navigate freely while it completes.

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Books Not Appearing

**Check:**
- Docker volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`
- File formats are supported
- Files have proper extensions (.epub, .pdf, etc.)
- Container logs for permission errors

### Slow Processing

**Solutions:**
- Increase Docker memory/CPU limits
- Process network folders in batches
- Temporarily disable monitoring during scan
- Split into smaller libraries

### Missing Metadata

**Solutions:**
- Use online metadata fetchers
- Manually add covers/data via editor
- Check file integrity

### Monitoring Not Working

**Solutions:**
- Verify monitoring enabled in settings
- Trigger manual scan: Library settings ‚Üí Scan Now
- Use scheduled scans for network folders
