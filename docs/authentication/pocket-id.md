# üîê Pocket ID Authentication

Seamlessly integrate Pocket ID as your single sign-on (SSO) provider for Booklore. Simplify user authentication, enhance security, and provide a streamlined login experience across your applications.

:::danger[Username Matching Required]
The username in Pocket ID must exactly match the username in Booklore for authentication to work properly. Case sensitivity matters. If a user doesn't exist in Booklore with the matching username, authentication will fail.

## ‚ú® How Pocket ID Integration Works

### üîÑ The Authentication Flow

Understanding the authentication flow helps troubleshoot issues and explains what happens behind the scenes:

1. **üé´ User Initiates Login**  
   User attempts to access Booklore and is redirected to Pocket ID's secure login portal. The original destination URL is preserved for automatic redirect after authentication.

2. **üîë Pocket ID Authenticates**  
   User enters credentials in Pocket ID's login page. Pocket ID validates the credentials against its user directory and verifies the user's identity.

3. **‚úÖ Token Exchange**  
   Pocket ID validates credentials and issues OAuth2 tokens (access token, ID token). These tokens contain user information and are cryptographically signed for security.

4. **üö™ Access Granted**  
   Booklore receives and validates the tokens, extracts user information, matches it with an existing Booklore user account, and grants access to the authenticated user.

## üöÄ Setting Up Pocket ID

### Step 1: Create OIDC Client in Pocket ID

Begin by configuring Booklore as an OIDC client in Pocket ID. This process should take about 5 minutes:

1. **Navigate to OIDC Clients**  
   Open your Pocket ID admin panel and navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Administration ‚Üí OIDC Clients**. Click the **"Add OIDC Client"** button to begin the setup process.

   ![Access OIDC Client UI](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--1-create-client-access-ui.jpg)

2. **Configure Client Details**

   Fill in the OIDC client configuration form with the following information:

   ![Configure Client](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--2-create-client-fill-info.jpg)

   - **Name:** `Booklore` (or your preferred name) - This name will be displayed to users in the Pocket ID dashboard
   - **Callback URLs:** Configure the redirect URIs where Pocket ID should send users after authentication:
     - `https://<your-booklore-domain>/oauth2/callback/` - The exact callback endpoint (trailing slash required)
     - `https://<your-booklore-domain>/*` - Pattern allowing flexibility for various OAuth flows
   - **Public Client:** Toggle **ON** - Public clients are suitable for applications running in browsers
   - **Client Launch URL:** `https://<your-booklore-domain>/` - The main URL where your Booklore instance is hosted
   - Click **Save** to create the client

   :::danger[Important: Callback URL Format]
   Ensure the trailing slash is included in the callback URL. Use your actual domain without brackets or placeholders. Incorrect redirect URIs are the most common cause of authentication failures.
   :::

   **Example for a production setup:**
   ```
   Callback URLs:
   - https://books.example.com/oauth2/callback/
   - https://books.example.com/*
   Client Launch URL: https://books.example.com/
   ```

   **Example for local testing:**
   ```
   Callback URLs:
   - http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback/
   - http://localhost:3000/*
   Client Launch URL: http://localhost:3000/
   ```

   :::note[Public Client Type]
   Public client type is appropriate for applications where the client secret cannot be kept confidential. Booklore's frontend needs to initiate the OAuth flow, making this the correct choice.
   :::

---

### Step 2: Retrieve Client Credentials

After creating the OIDC client, you'll need to copy the credentials for Booklore configuration:

![Copy Client ID](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--3-create-client-copy-client-id.jpg)

1. **Copy Client ID**  
   After saving the client configuration, a **Client ID** will be automatically generated. This is a unique identifier for your Booklore application.
   
   - Copy this Client ID to a secure location
   - You'll need this in the next step to configure Booklore

2. **Note the Issuer URL**  
   Your Pocket ID issuer URL will be: `https://<your-pocket-id-domain>/`
   - Make sure to include the trailing slash
   - This is the base URL where your Pocket ID instance is hosted

:::tip[Save These Credentials]
Copy the Client ID and note your Pocket ID domain. You'll paste these into Booklore in the next step. Keep this information secure as it's required to establish the connection.
:::

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Booklore

### Step 3: Connect Booklore to Pocket ID

Now configure Booklore to use Pocket ID as the authentication provider. This is the final configuration step:

![Configure Booklore](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--4-configure-booklore.jpg)

1. **Open Booklore Settings**  
   Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Authentication** in your Booklore admin interface. You'll need administrator privileges to access this section.

2. **Configure OIDC Provider**
   
   In the **OIDC Authentication** section, enter the following details:
   
   - **Provider Name:** `Pocket ID` (or your preferred display name)
     - This name appears on the login button, so make it recognizable to users
   - **Client ID:** Paste the Client ID you copied from Pocket ID
     - Ensure there are no extra spaces before or after
   - **Issuer URL:** Enter your Pocket ID URL: `https://<your-pocket-id-domain>/`
     - Must include the trailing slash
     - Example: `https://auth.example.com/`
   - Click **Save** to store the configuration

3. **Enable OIDC Authentication**  
   Toggle **"OIDC Enabled"** to **ON** to activate Pocket ID authentication
   - When enabled, users will see a "Login with Pocket ID" button on the Booklore login page
   - The standard username/password login will still be available unless specifically disabled

:::success[Configuration Complete!]
Booklore is now configured to use Pocket ID for authentication. The next step is testing the integration to ensure everything works correctly.
:::

## üîÑ Managing Authentication

### Disabling Pocket ID Authentication

If you need to temporarily disable or switch authentication methods (for maintenance or troubleshooting):

![Disable OIDC](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--7-disable-pocket-id.jpg)

1. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**  
   Go to **Booklore ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authentication**

2. **Disable OIDC**  
   Toggle **"OIDC Enabled"** to **OFF**
   - This immediately disables Pocket ID authentication
   - Active sessions remain valid until they expire
   - New login attempts will use standard authentication

3. **Log Out**  
   Click **Logout** to end your current session and verify the change

4. **Standard Login Returns**  
   You'll be redirected to the standard Booklore login page with username/password fields

![Booklore Login](/img/authentication/pocket-id/pocket-id--8-booklore-login-screen.jpg)

:::note[Configuration Persistence]
Disabling OIDC doesn't delete your Pocket ID configuration. All settings (Client ID, Issuer URL) are preserved. You can re-enable it anytime by toggling the switch back on. Users who were authenticated via Pocket ID can still log in with standard credentials if they have them configured.
