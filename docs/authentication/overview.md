# üîê Authentication Overview

Booklore offers flexible authentication to secure your library while keeping things simple. Out of the box, it works with built-in username and password authentication, no setup required. If you're already running an identity provider like Authentik or Pocket ID for your other self-hosted apps, Booklore can integrate seamlessly via OpenID Connect (OIDC), giving you single sign-on across your entire stack.

Both methods can run side-by-side, so you can keep local authentication as a backup while using OIDC for daily access. This guide will help you understand your options and get started with the authentication method that fits your setup.

## üéØ Authentication Methods

### üè† Local Authentication (Built-in)

Booklore includes built-in username and password authentication that works immediately after installation:

- **Self-Contained** - No external dependencies required
- **Quick Setup** - Ready to use with zero configuration
- **Always Available** - Works as a fallback even when OIDC is enabled

**Perfect for:**
- Getting started without extra dependencies
- Keeping authentication simple and self-contained
- Running Booklore as a standalone service

### üåê OIDC Authentication (Optional)

Integrate with OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers for centralized authentication:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Authenticate once across multiple applications
- **Centralized Management** - Control users from your identity provider
- **Enhanced Security** - MFA, audit logs, and additional security features
- **Standard Compliant** - Works with any OAuth2/OIDC provider

**Supported Identity Providers:**
- ‚úÖ Authentik (detailed setup guide available)
- ‚úÖ Pocket ID (guide coming soon)
- ‚úÖ Authelia (not tested yet)

**Perfect for:**
- Already running an identity provider for other apps

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I use both local and OIDC authentication?**  
A: Yes! Enable both and users can choose their preferred method.

**Q: What if my identity provider goes down?**  
A: Local authentication stays available, so you can always log in.

**Q: Do I need to migrate users when enabling OIDC?**  
A: No. Just create matching usernames in your identity provider when you're ready.

**Q: Does OIDC support MFA?**  
A: Yes! Whatever security features your identity provider has (MFA, hardware keys, etc.) will work automatically.

**Q: Are usernames case-sensitive?**  
A: Yes. Make sure usernames match exactly between Booklore and your identity provider.
