# üìö OPDS Integration Guide

OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) allows you to access your Booklore library from various reading apps and devices. This guide will walk you through setting up OPDS feeds and connecting your favorite reading apps to your Booklore collection.

---

## üîß What is OPDS?

OPDS is an open standard that enables reading applications to discover and access digital publications. With OPDS enabled in Booklore, you can:

- Browse your library from any OPDS-compatible reading app
- Download books directly to your reading device
- Access your collection from multiple devices seamlessly
- Use apps like KOReader, Aldiko, FBReader, and many others

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Configure OPDS Server

First, let's enable and configure the OPDS server in your Booklore settings.

![OPDS Settings](/img/opds/opds.jpg)

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **OPDS** in Booklore
2. Under **Server Control**, toggle **OPDS Server Enabled** to activate the service

:::info[Note]
By default, all libraries you have access to will be included in the OPDS feed.
:::

## üîó Step 2: Get Your OPDS Catalog URL

Booklore provides a single OPDS endpoint for accessing your catalog:

### OPDS Catalog URL

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/opds`
- **Compatibility:** Works with most OPDS-compatible reading apps
- **Authentication:** Requires OPDS user credentials (see Step 3)

You can copy this URL directly from the **OPDS Endpoint** section in your settings.

:::tip[Network Access]
Replace `localhost:8080` with your actual Booklore server address when accessing from other devices on your network.
:::

---

## üë§ Step 3: Create OPDS Users

To access your OPDS feed, you'll need to create dedicated OPDS user credentials.

1. In the **OPDS Users** section, click **Add User**
2. Fill in the user details:

| Field        | Description                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Username** | Choose a username for OPDS access           |
| **Password** | Create a strong password for this OPDS user |

3. Click **Create** to create the OPDS user

:::danger[Security Note]
OPDS users are separate from your main Booklore account and are specifically for reading app access.
:::

:::warning[Important]
Passwords are created once and cannot be retrieved later. Make sure to store your OPDS credentials securely before saving.

## üì± Step 4: Connect Reading Apps

Now that your OPDS server is configured, you can connect various reading apps to access your Booklore library.

### Popular OPDS-Compatible Apps:

2. Look for **OPDS**, **Catalog**, or **Online Library** settings
3. Add a new OPDS catalog/server
4. Enter the OPDS URL: `http://your-booklore-domain/api/v1/opds`
5. Enter your OPDS username and password
6. Save and browse your library

## üåê Network Considerations

### Local Network Access

:::info[Local Network Access]
Replace `localhost:8080` with your actual Booklore server IP address when connecting from other devices on your local network.

Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/v1/opds`
:::
