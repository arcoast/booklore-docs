## ⚙️ nginx Proxy Configuration

If you're using nginx as a reverse proxy in front of Booklore, the following configuration is required for Kobo sync to work properly:

```nginx
# Required headers for Kobo sync
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;

# Required buffer settings
proxy_buffer_size 128k;
proxy_buffers 4 256k;
proxy_busy_buffers_size 256k;
large_client_header_buffers 8 32k;
```

:::info[Nginx Proxy Manager Users]
The proxy headers are already configured automatically in nginx Proxy Manager, but you'll still need to add the buffer settings manually as they are required for proper functionality.
:::

:::warning[Other Reverse Proxies]
If you're using Caddy, Traefik, or other reverse proxy solutions, you'll need to configure equivalent headers and buffer settings manually. Consult your proxy's documentation for the appropriate configuration.
