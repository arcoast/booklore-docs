# üóÑÔ∏è Shelves

Shelves are one of the key organization features in Booklore. Just like shelves in a physical library, they let you group books by theme, purpose, or preference, for example: *"To Read Next"*, *"My Favorites"*, or *"Sci-Fi Picks"*.

Books on a shelf can come from multiple libraries, and a single book can belong to multiple shelves.

:::info[Default Shelves]
Booklore comes with a built-in **Favorites** shelf to help you quickly access your favorite reads.  
You‚Äôll also see an **Unshelved** section, this automatically lists books that haven‚Äôt been added to any shelf yet.
