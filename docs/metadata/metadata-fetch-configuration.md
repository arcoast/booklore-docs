## üåü What You'll Achieve

With advanced metadata fetch configuration, you can:

- **Prioritize metadata sources** - Choose which provider to try first, second, third, and fourth for each field
- **Enable/disable specific fields** - Fetch only the metadata you need
- **Control cover updates** - Decide whether to refresh existing book covers
- **Manage genre merging** - Choose to combine or replace existing genres
- **Review before applying** - Preview and approve changes before saving

:::tip[Smart Fallback System]
If your first-choice provider doesn't have data for a field, Booklore automatically tries your second choice, then third, then fourth. This ensures you get the most complete metadata possible.

## üéØ Understanding the Priority System

### How Priorities Work

When Booklore fetches metadata for a book:

1. **1st Priority (P1)**: The system tries your first-choice provider
2. **2nd Priority (P2)**: If P1 doesn't have data, tries your second choice
3. **3rd Priority (P3)**: If P2 doesn't have data, tries your third choice
4. **4th Priority (P4)**: Final fallback if all previous priorities fail

### Example Priority Configuration

For the "Title" field:

- **P1**: Google Books (try first)
- **P2**: Amazon (try second)
- **P3**: Goodreads (try third)
- **P4**: Hardcover (try last)

If Google Books doesn't have the title, the system automatically tries Amazon, then Goodreads, then Hardcover until it finds data.

:::warning[Required Priority]
At least one priority (P1, P2, P3, or P4) must be set for each enabled field, or the system will show an error.
:::

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Guide

### Step 1: Accessing the Configuration

1. **Navigate to Metadata Settings:**
    - Open the metadata fetch dialog in Booklore
    - Look for the advanced configuration section or button

2. **View Configuration Table:**
    - You'll see a table with all available fields
    - Each field has columns for the four priority levels

### Step 2: Understanding the Table Layout

The configuration table has six columns:

| Column           | Purpose                                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Enabled**      | Checkbox to enable/disable fetching this field |
| **Field**        | The metadata field name (e.g., Title, Authors) |
| **4th Priority** | Last fallback provider                         |
| **3rd Priority** | Third choice provider                          |
| **2nd Priority** | Second choice provider                         |
| **1st Priority** | First choice provider                          |

:::tip[Reading Order]
Priorities are displayed right-to-left (4th ‚Üí 1st) to make it easy to read the fallback sequence from left to right.
:::

### Step 3: Setting Individual Field Priorities

#### Enabling/Disabling Fields

1. **Enable a field:**
    - Check the checkbox in the "Enabled" column
    - The field will be fetched during metadata updates

2. **Disable a field:**
    - Uncheck the checkbox
    - The field will be skipped during metadata updates
    - Dropdowns become disabled (grayed out)

#### Selecting Providers

1. **Click the dropdown** for any priority level
2. **Choose a provider** from the list:
    - Amazon
    - Google
    - GoodReads
    - Hardcover
    - Comicvine
    - Douban
3. **Leave as "Unset"** if you don't want that priority level

#### Example: Configuring the "Description" Field

```
Field: Description
Enabled: ‚úì
P4: Hardcover
P3: Goodreads
P2: Amazon
P1: Google

Result: System tries Google first, then Amazon, then Goodreads, then Hardcover
```

### Step 4: Using Bulk Operations

To quickly set priorities for all fields at once:

1. **Locate the "Set All" row** at the top of the table
2. **Select a provider** from any priority column dropdown
3. **All enabled fields** automatically get that provider for that priority
4. **Select "Clear All"** to remove all providers for that priority level

#### Example Bulk Operation

Setting "Google" in the "Set All P1" dropdown:

- All enabled fields get "Google" as their 1st Priority
- You can still customize individual fields afterward

:::tip[Efficiency Tip]
Use bulk operations to set a base configuration, then fine-tune specific fields as needed.
