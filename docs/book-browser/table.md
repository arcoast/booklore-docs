# ðŸ“Š Browsing Books in Table View

Booklore offers two primary ways to explore your book collection:

- **Grid View**
- **Table View**

In this guide, weâ€™ll focus on the **Table View**, an efficient, data-rich layout ideal for managing large libraries. Books are displayed in a tabular format with sortable columns and quick actions.

To switch to Table View, click the view toggle button at the top of the library interface:

## Table View Features

At the top of the table, you'll find several controls to customize how your books are displayed and managed.

### 1. Visible Columns

Click the eye icon in the library header to open the **Visible Columns** panel. From here, you can choose which data columns to show or hide, such as ratings, format, source, or publisher.

### 4. Sidebar Filter Sorting

This option controls how filters (e.g., authors, categories, series) are sorted in the sidebar.

You can sort sidebar items by:

- **Alphabetical Order** â€“ For fast lookup by name.
- **Number of Books** â€“ To prioritize the most-used categories or prolific authors.

A confirmation dialog will appear to make sure youâ€™re aware of the consequences before proceeding.
